the idt(interrupts descriptor table) is a data structure that helps the cpu to handle interrupts and exceptions.

Interrupts: These are signals sent to the CPU by hardware devices (e.g., keyboard, timer) to request attention.

Exceptions: These are events generated by the CPU itself when something unexpected happens (e.g., division by zero, page fault).

each descriptor in the idt contains the address of an interrupt handler(ISR), a segment selector and permission flags. when an interrupt or exceptions occurs, the cpu looks up the corresponding entry in the idt, jumps to the address of the interrupt handler and execute it. 
each entry in the idt is a 8 bytes structure that tells the cpu where to jump when an
interrupt occurs. each entry stores the address of the interrupt handler (ISR) and define 
privilege level.

In the IDT entry structure, the selector field will generally hold the value 0x08, because that's the selector for the code segment descriptor defined in the GDT. Since interrupt handlers are code that need to execute, the CPU requires a valid code segment to run them.
