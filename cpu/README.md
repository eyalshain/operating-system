the idt(interrupts descriptor table) is a data structure that helps the cpu to handle interrupts and exceptions.

Interrupts: These are signals sent to the CPU by hardware devices (e.g., keyboard, timer) to request attention.

Exceptions: These are events generated by the CPU itself when something unexpected happens (e.g., division by zero, page fault).

Devices (e.g., keyboard, timer) send interrupt requests (IRQs) to the PIC.
The PIC prioritizes the interrupts and sends a single interrupt signal to the CPU.
The CPU stops what itâ€™s doing and asks the PIC which interrupt occurred.
The PIC responds with the IRQ number (e.g., IRQ 0 for the timer, IRQ 1 for the keyboard).
The CPU uses the IRQ number to find the corresponding Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) in the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).
