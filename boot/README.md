boot process:
1. Power-On and BIOS/UEFI Initialization
When you power on your computer, the following happens:

Power-On Self-Test (POST):

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) performs a hardware check to ensure all components (CPU, RAM, storage devices, etc.) are functioning correctly.

If any issues are detected, the BIOS/UEFI will emit beep codes or display error messages.

BIOS/UEFI Firmware Initialization:

The BIOS/UEFI firmware initializes hardware devices and sets up the environment for booting the operating system.

It looks for a bootable device (e.g., hard drive, SSD, USB, CD/DVD) based on the boot order configured in the BIOS/UEFI settings.

Loading the Boot Device:

Once a bootable device is found, the BIOS/UEFI reads the first sector of the device (512 bytes) into memory at address 0x7C00. This sector is called the Master Boot Record (MBR).

2. Master Boot Record (MBR)
The MBR is a 512-byte sector located at the very beginning of a storage device (e.g., hard drive). It contains the following:

Bootstrap Code (446 bytes):

This is the first stage of the bootloader. It’s a small program that the BIOS/UEFI loads into memory and executes.

Its primary job is to locate and load the second stage bootloader (usually located in the VBR or another partition).

Partition Table (64 bytes):

The partition table contains information about up to four primary partitions on the disk.

Each partition entry is 16 bytes and includes:

Partition type (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, Linux).

Starting sector of the partition.

Size of the partition.

MBR Signature (2 bytes):

The last two bytes of the MBR are a signature (0x55AA). If this signature is missing, the BIOS/UEFI will consider the disk unbootable.

3. Volume Boot Record (VBR)
The VBR is located at the beginning of each partition (not the entire disk, like the MBR). It contains:

Bootstrap Code:

This is the second stage bootloader. It’s responsible for loading the operating system kernel.

The VBR bootstrap code is specific to the file system on the partition (e.g., FAT32, NTFS, ext4).

File System Information:

The VBR contains metadata about the file system, such as the size of clusters, the location of the root directory, and other parameters needed to read files.

Bootloader:

The bootloader in the VBR is more advanced than the one in the MBR. It can:

Load the operating system kernel from the file system.

Provide a boot menu (e.g., GRUB for Linux or Windows Boot Manager).

Handle multiple operating systems (dual-boot).

4. Bootloader
The bootloader is a critical component that bridges the gap between the BIOS/UEFI and the operating system. It has two main stages:

Stage 1: MBR Bootloader
Located in the MBR.

Loads the Stage 2 bootloader from the VBR or another location on the disk.

Stage 2: VBR Bootloader
Located in the VBR or a separate boot partition.

Provides advanced functionality, such as:

Loading the operating system kernel.

Displaying a boot menu (e.g., to choose between different operating systems).

Handling file systems (e.g., reading the kernel from a file).

Popular Bootloaders
GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader): Used in Linux systems.

Windows Boot Manager: Used in Windows systems.

SYSLINUX: Used for booting from FAT file systems.

5. Loading the Operating System Kernel
Once the bootloader has done its job, it loads the operating system kernel into memory. Here’s how it works:

Locate the Kernel:

The bootloader reads the file system to locate the kernel (e.g., vmlinuz for Linux or ntoskrnl.exe for Windows).

Load the Kernel:

The kernel is loaded into memory at a specific address (e.g., 0x1000 for simple OS projects).

Hand Over Control:

The bootloader jumps to the kernel’s entry point, transferring control to the operating system.

6. Kernel Initialization
The kernel is the core of the operating system. Once loaded, it performs the following tasks:

Hardware Initialization:

The kernel initializes hardware devices (e.g., CPU, memory, storage, peripherals).

Memory Management:

Sets up virtual memory, paging, and memory protection.

Process Management:

Initializes the first process (usually init or systemd in Linux).

File System Initialization:

Mounts the root file system.

User Space Initialization:

Starts user-space processes (e.g., login prompt, graphical interface).
